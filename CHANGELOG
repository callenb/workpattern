## Workpattern v0.?.0 ( 10 Feb, 2021) ##

I stopped keeping this Changelog file update back when v0.5.0 was realeased on 19 Oct 2016 and now it is 10Feb 2021 and I'm playing catch-up.
I have created the following set of bullet point changes by going through my commit messages, the quality of which varies greatly.  
A lot of the effort has been on making the code easier to read as it was a real mess.
Here is a chronological take on what I have been doing.

* removed test warnings by surrounding ambiguous negatives with parenthesis
* I think a bug was fixed by changing #wee_total and #total to just an attr_writer
* removed some duplicated code
* replaced a number of literals with constants which I put in their own file
* made a lot of the code easier to read, such as extracting to a method with a sensible name or renaming existing ones
* Workpattern is now tested on Ruby 1.9.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, ruby-head, jruby-19mode & jruby-head
* Created a Day class to remove the complexity from Week so Week deals with weeks and Day with a day
* My Clock class was replaced by Time or Date objects in all tests.  Clock only used for internal stuff now.
* Switched to sorted_set rubygem after the SortedSet class was removed from Ruby in v3.x.
* Workpattern now works with ruby 3.0.1dev
