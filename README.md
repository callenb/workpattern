## What?

Simple addition and subtraction of minutes on dates taking account of real-life working and resting periods.

This gem has the potential to serve as the engine for scheduling algorithms that are the core of products such as Microsoft Project and Oracle Primavera P6 as well as other applications that need to know when they can perform work and when they canâ€™t.

## Install

  `sudo gem install workpattern`

## Getting Started

The first step is to create a **Workpattern** to hold all the working and resting times.  I'll start in 2011 and let it run for 10 years.

``` ruby
mywp=Workpattern.new('My Workpattern',2011,10)
```

My **Workpattern** will be created as a 24 hour a day full working time.  Now it has to be told about the resting periods.  First the weekends.

``` ruby
mywp.resting(:days => :weekend)
```

then the days in the week have specific working and resting times using the *Workpattern.clock* method, although anything that responds to **hour** and **min** methods will do ...

``` ruby
mywp.resting(:days =>:weekday, :from_time=>Workpattern.clock(0,0),:to_time=>Workpattern.clock(8,59))
mywp.resting(:days =>:weekday, :from_time=>Workpattern.clock(12,0),:to_time=>Workpattern.clock(12,59))
mywp.resting(:days =>:weekday, :from_time=>Workpattern.clock(18,0),:to_time=>Workpattern.clock(23,59))
```

Now we have the working and resting periods setup we can just add 32 hours as minutes (1920) to our date.

``` ruby
mydate=DateTime.civil(2011,9,1,9,0)
result_date = mywp.calc(mydate,1920) # => 6/9/11@18:00
```

## Development

* Source hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/callenb/workpattern).
* Direct questions and discussions to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/workpattern).
* Report issues on [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/callenb/workpattern/issues).
* Pull requests are very welcome, however I have never participated in Open Source so will be a bit slow as I am learning. Please be patient with me.  Please include spec and/or feature coverage for every patch,  and create a topic branch for every separate change you make.
* Advice, such as pointing out how I should really code in Ruby will be gratefully received.
