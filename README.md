# Workpattern [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/callenb/workpattern.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/callenb/workpattern.png)

## What?

Simple addition and subtraction of minutes on dates taking account of real-life working and resting periods.

## So What?

The core Ruby classes that represent date and time allow calculations by adding a duration such as days or 
minutes to a date and returning the new `Date` or `DateTime` as the result.  Although there 
are 60 seconds in every minute and 60 minutes in every hour, there aren't always 24 hours in every day, and 
if there was, we still wouldn't be working during all of them.  We would be doing other things like eating,
sleeping, travelling and having a bit of leisure time.  Workpattern refers to this time as Resting time.
It refers to the time when we're busy doing stuff as Working time.

When it comes to scheduling work, whether part of a project, teachers in a classroom or even bed availability
in a hospital, the working day can have anything from 0 hours to the full 24 hours.  Most office based work
is something like 7.5 or 8 hours a day except weekends, public holidays and vacations when no work takes 
place.

The `Workpattern` library was born to allow date related calculations to take  into account real life 
working and resting times.  It gets told about working and resting periods and can then perform calculations
on a given date.  It can add and subtract a number of minutes, calculate the working minutes between two dates 
and say whether a specific minute is working or resting.

This gem has the potential to serve as the engine for scheduling algorithms that are the core of products such as Microsoft Project and Oracle Primavera P6 as well as other applications that need to know when they can perform work and when they canâ€™t.

## Install

  `sudo gem install workpattern`

## Getting Started

The first step is to create a `Workpattern` to hold all the working and resting times.  I'll start in 2011 and let it run for 10 years.

``` ruby
mywp=Workpattern.new('My Workpattern',2011,10)
```

My `Workpattern` will be created as a 24 hour a day full working time.  Now it has to be told about the resting periods.  First the weekends.

``` ruby
mywp.resting(:days => :weekend)
```

then the days in the week have specific working and resting times using the *Workpattern.clock* method, although anything that responds to `#hour` and `#min` methods will do ...

``` ruby
mywp.resting(:days =>:weekday, :from_time=>Workpattern.clock(0,0),:to_time=>Workpattern.clock(8,59))
mywp.resting(:days =>:weekday, :from_time=>Workpattern.clock(12,0),:to_time=>Workpattern.clock(12,59))
mywp.resting(:days =>:weekday, :from_time=>Workpattern.clock(18,0),:to_time=>Workpattern.clock(23,59))
```

Now we have the working and resting periods setup we can just add 32 hours as minutes (1920) to our date.

``` ruby
mydate=DateTime.civil(2011,9,1,9,0)
result_date = mywp.calc(mydate,1920) # => 6/9/11@18:00
```

## Development

* Source hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/callenb/workpattern).
* Direct questions and discussions to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/workpattern).
* Report issues on [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/callenb/workpattern/issues).
* Pull requests are very welcome, however I have never participated in Open Source so will be a bit slow as I am learning. Please be patient with me.  Please include spec and/or feature coverage for every patch,  and create a topic branch for every separate change you make.
* Advice, such as pointing out how I should really code in Ruby will be gratefully received.

## Things To Do

In its current form this library is being made available to see if there is any interest in using 
it. At the moment it can perform the following:

* define the working and resting minutes for any 24 hour day
* given a date it can return the resulting date after adding or subtracting a number of minutes
* calculate the number of working minutes between two dates
* report whether a specific minute in time is working or resting

This is what I consider to be the basics, but there are a number of functional and non-functial areas I 
would like to address in a future version.

## Functional

* Merge two Workpatterns together to create a new one allowing either resting or working to take precedence
* Given a date, find the next working or resting minute either before or after it.
* Handle both 23 and 25 hour days that occur when the clocks change.
* Extract patterns from the workpattern so they can be persisted in a database.
* Decide how to handle different Timezones apart from UTC.

## Non-Functional

* Improve the documentation and introduce real world use as an example
* Improve my ability to write Ruby code
